# ncal

This command displays calendar information similar to the Linux ncal command. It implements most of the main functionality, including the ability to display multiple months, years, week numbers and with today highlighted. 
    
813 locales have been tested, with localised month names and day abbreviations being used. Some abbreviations are of mixed length and with unicode characters. Consequently, the formatting with a few locales is messy, but the command should work everywhere.
